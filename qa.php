								A: Traditional cleaning products contain chemicals that pose a multitude of
								human health and ecological concerns. Some of these products used improperly
								can even be deadly. Many common cleaning agents are made from petroleum (a
								nonrenewable source) and other products that leave toxic residue on household
								
								surfaces and in our water supply. SOBE Organic strictly uses 100 % Organic bio-
								based cleaning products that are safe for you and our environment.

								to leave your home spic-and-span.
