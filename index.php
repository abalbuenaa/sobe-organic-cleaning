								Our Mantra
							</h1>
							<img class="imgfix" src="img/world-on-leaf.jpg" alt="World on a leaf" />
							<p class="dropcap">
								SOBE Organic Cleaning was started by a				(incredibly frustrated) luxury apartment property				manager, who was obsessed with cleanliness and 
								great customer service. He was disturbed by the 
								long-term health and environmental effects of 
								traditional cleaning products and tired of lazy, 
								unprofessional cleaning services.
							</p>
							<p>
								He understood the &quot;Green&quot; demand in the 
								Washington D.C. Metropolitan area, and thus 
								decided to create SOBE Organic Cleaning, 
								the &quot;ultimate solution for a cleaner environment.&quot;
							</p>
							<p>
								The SOBE Organic Cleaning mission is to improve, 
								inform and enrich the lives of the people we 
								service. We accomplish this through the use 
								of non-toxic, eco-friendly products and a 
								professional work ethic. Our goal is to provide our 
								valued clients efficient and reliable services that 
								supersede our competitors. We proudly make this 
								happen without making a dramatic change in your 
								lifestyle or a huge dent in your wallet.

								Go Green
							</h1>
							<h2>
								Why Join Our "Green" Movement
							</h2>
							<div	class="">
								<p class="dropcap">
									You've probably noticed that the term "green" is everywhere nowadays—promulgated by just
									about every media source with which you come into contact.<img src="img/lady-recycling.jpg" alt="Lady recycling" width="200" height="300" class="imgfix"> You can hardly escape the pleas
									from tree-huggers across the country advocating going "green" and saving the world, but with
									the myriad messages coming at us from all sides, it's hard not to begin suffering from a little
									green "fatigue"—that is, tuning out the barrage of green messages we receive due to the constant
									bombardment we're subjected to on a daily basis.
								</p>
								<p>
									While it's natural to feel a tad overwhelmed, it's actually helpful if you take a step back and
									look at what going green really means; in that way, you can take a logical look at the reasons
									behind why we all should go green, analyze the practicality of this implementation in your life
									and begin setting small, realistic goals for yourself and your family. Green living will not happen
									overnight; it starts with one initial lifestyle change and grows consistently from there. As a
									family, or maybe just individually, if you commit to making one change toward living green no
									doubt you will find that you are soon making many more, as greener living becomes a healthy
									habit.
								</p>
								<p>
									So…what does going "green" really mean? And exactly what is going green anyways?
								</p>
								<p>
									Well, going green simply means that you've made a conscious decision to live in harmony with
									the Earth by making choices in your daily life that support the health of the environment and
									reduce harm to our planet. Going green is a choice we make to take care of the Earth, just as we
									would take care of our health, our children, and our families. In fact, going green helps improve
									your health and the health of your family, as well as the health of the world in which we live.
									Green living is a whole-life proposition that leads you to living the healthiest life possible, while
									making as little a negative impact as possible.
								</p>
								<aside>
									<p>
										Did you know...
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li> For every ton of paper that is recycled, the following is saved: 7,000 gallons of
											water; 380 gallons of oil; and enough electricity to power an average house for six
											months. </li>
										<li>You can run a TV for six hours on the amount of electricity that is saved by
											recycling one aluminum can. </li>
										<li>By recycling just one glass bottle, you save enough electricity to power a 100-
											watt bulb for four hours. </li>
									</ul>
								</aside>

							<h2>
								The Benefits of Green Cleaning
							</h2>
							<div class="">
								<p>
									Why go green? And better yet, how can we possibly find the time and energy to make more
									changes to our already hectic lives, even if those changes are for the betterment of the world?
									Well, the good news is that there are so many benefits to going green that you will find your
									whole life changing for the better once you simply make the commitment...even if you start
									small!
								</p>
								<p>
									A simple first step in the process of living a longer, greener life is by changing how we clean
									our homes. By using green cleaning products, we are reducing the amount of pollutants in our
									home, as well as those we expose to the Earth. In most instances, it also saves us money to boot!
								</p>
								<p>
									Green cleaning products are designed NOT to harm our homes, possessions, ground water or
									planet. They're not nearly as harsh on the skin as some of the toxic chemicals we've grown
									accustomed to using, and most are made out of natural, recyclable materials.
								</p>
								<strong> What Are Some Other Simple Steps You Can Take Toward A Greener Future? </strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Drive less. </li>
									<li>Turn off unused appliances. </li>
									<li>Unplug chargers. </li>
									<li>Turn out the lights. </li>
									<li>Take shorter showers. </li>
									<li>Adjust the thermostat. </li>
									<li>Eat less meat. </li>
									<li>Wash clothes in cold water. </li>
									<li>DITCH the plastic. </li>
									<li>Reduce! Reuse! Recycle! Rethink! </li>
								</ul>

							During our first visit we utilize our eco-friendly, “impact cleaning” technique to
							thoroughly clean and sanitize your entire home. <img src="img/tree-on-field.jpg" alt="Tree on a field" width="300" height="200" class="imgfix">This initial cleaning can take up

							of love and attention. In order to maintain consistent levels of great service and
							efficiency, we always appreciate our customers’ straightforwardness if they feel we
							may need to spend more time than typically needed for the initial cleaning. We can
							extend your service times or levels, as well as focus on specific areas based on your

						<h2>
							SOBE Organic Standard Cleaning Services
						</h2>
						<span><small>*Including, but not limited to...</small></span>
						<h3>
							Kitchen
						</h3>
						<p>
						 	We know that for most of our clients the kitchen is the most popular space in their
							home; however, because of this fact it also has infamously high levels of bacteria
							and other pesky germs. We take the time to clean and sanitize your entire kitchen
							using eco-friendly products and cleaning methods. Your sinks will not only be washed,
							but also thoroughly disinfected. All countertops and stovetops will be cleaned, and
							appliance exteriors left spotless. The floors will be swept and hand washed.
						</p>
						<h3 class="clearfix">
							Bathroom
						</h3>
						<p>
							The Bathroom, much like the kitchen, is notorious for being germ-leaden.
							Normal bathroom cleansers tend to coat germs, not eliminate them. Our cleaning
							professionals always leave your toilets, sinks, and tubs cleaned to a shine and
							thoroughly disinfected. All glass and mirrors are left sparkling clean. At SOBE
							Organic Cleaning our technicians sanitize all surfaces and hand wash bathroom
							floor — we don’t miss a spot.
						</p>
						<h3 class="clearfix">
							All rooms
						</h3 class="clearfix">
						<p>
							All rooms will be cleaned with the same attention to detail. Baseboards and ceiling
							fans are never overlooked. Linens in bedrooms can be changed, as long as the client has left a fresh set out for
							the cleaner. Carpets are thoroughly vacuumed and left allergen-free, as we use the
							latest HEPA filtrate vacuums that capture 99.98% of dust particles most regular
							vacuums leave behind, allowing you to breathe clean fresh air.
						</p>
						<h3 class="clearfix">
							Move in/out
						</h3>
						<p>
							We offer a move in/out service fit to your needs. Whether you are moving in to a
							new space or out of you old, we guarantee your home will look as though no one has
							ever lived there.

								<img src="img/guy-resting-on-grass.jpg" alt="Guy resting on grass" width="349" height="233" class="imgfix">
							</p>
							<p class="msg_body">
								A: Traditional cleaning products contain chemicals that pose a multitude of
								human health and ecological concerns. Some of these products used improperly
								can even be deadly. Many common cleaning agents are made from petroleum (a
								nonrenewable source) and other products that leave toxic residue on household
								
								surfaces and in our water supply. SOBE Organic strictly uses 100 % Organic bio-
								based cleaning products that are safe for you and our environment.
							</p>
							<p class="msg_head">
								Q: Do I need to provide the cleaning supplies & equipment?

								counter. Our cleaning technician will collect the payment and you will receive
								a receipt via email within 24 hours. For all credit card payments, we require
								clients to simply complete a credit card authorization form.
							</p>
							<p class="msg_head">
								Q: Are you insured and bonded?
							</p>
							<p class="msg_body">
								A: Absolutely!
							</p>
							<p class="msg_head">
								Q: Do I need to be home when you clean?
							</p>
							<p class="msg_body">

								require that you leave us with permission to enter.
							</p>
							<p class="msg_head">
								Q: What should I do with me pets?
							</p>
							<p class="msg_body">
								A: SOBE team member's work safely around house pets. We understand that
								our clients consider their pets to be part of the family. We take great care to
								minimize the stress that an animal endures when strangers enter their home.
								Please let us know if your pet has any special needs or requirements while we
								perform your healthy home cleaning. Most of our clients prefer to keep their
								pets in a contained area so our cleaning technicians can clean efficiently.
							</p>
							<p class="msg_head">
								Q: What about tipping?
							</p>
							<p class="msg_body">
								A: Tipping is totally optional. Our professional cleaning team will always strive

								members (including drug tests).
							</p>
							<p class="msg_head">
								Q: What if I'm not satisfied with the cleaning service?
							</p>
							<p class="msg_body">
								A: Our clients are our top priority! If anything is not up to par, please do not
								hesitate to contact us immediately. A satisfied client is a happy client.
							</p>
							<p class="msg_head">
								Q: Do you offer a referral discount?

							<p class="msg_body">
