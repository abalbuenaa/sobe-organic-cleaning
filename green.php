									You've probably noticed that the term "green" is everywhere nowadays—promulgated by just
									about every media source with which you come into contact.<img src="img/lady-recycling.jpg" alt="Lady recycling" width="200" height="300" class="imgfix"> You can hardly escape the pleas
									from tree-huggers across the country advocating going "green" and saving the world, but with
									the myriad messages coming at us from all sides, it's hard not to begin suffering from a little
									green "fatigue"—that is, tuning out the barrage of green messages we receive due to the constant
									bombardment we're subjected to on a daily basis.
								</p>
								<p>
									While it's natural to feel a tad overwhelmed, it's actually helpful if you take a step back and
									look at what going green really means; in that way, you can take a logical look at the reasons
									behind why we all should go green, analyze the practicality of this implementation in your life
									and begin setting small, realistic goals for yourself and your family. Green living will not happen
									overnight; it starts with one initial lifestyle change and grows consistently from there. As a
									family, or maybe just individually, if you commit to making one change toward living green no
									doubt you will find that you are soon making many more, as greener living becomes a healthy
									habit.
								</p>
								<p>
									So…what does going "green" really mean? And exactly what is going green anyways?
								</p>
								<p>
									Well, going green simply means that you've made a conscious decision to live in harmony with
									the Earth by making choices in your daily life that support the health of the environment and
									reduce harm to our planet. Going green is a choice we make to take care of the Earth, just as we
									would take care of our health, our children, and our families. In fact, going green helps improve
									your health and the health of your family, as well as the health of the world in which we live.
									Green living is a whole-life proposition that leads you to living the healthiest life possible, while
									making as little a negative impact as possible.

									<ul>
										<li> For every ton of paper that is recycled, the following is saved: 7,000 gallons of
											water; 380 gallons of oil; and enough electricity to power an average house for six
											months. </li>
										<li>You can run a TV for six hours on the amount of electricity that is saved by
											recycling one aluminum can. </li>
										<li>By recycling just one glass bottle, you save enough electricity to power a 100-
											watt bulb for four hours. </li>

								The Benefits of Green Cleaning
							</h2>
							<div class="">
								<p>
									Why go green? And better yet, how can we possibly find the time and energy to make more
									changes to our already hectic lives, even if those changes are for the betterment of the world?
									Well, the good news is that there are so many benefits to going green that you will find your
									whole life changing for the better once you simply make the commitment...even if you start
									small!
								</p>
								<p>
									A simple first step in the process of living a longer, greener life is by changing how we clean
									our homes. By using green cleaning products, we are reducing the amount of pollutants in our
									home, as well as those we expose to the Earth. In most instances, it also saves us money to boot!
								</p>
								<p>
									Green cleaning products are designed NOT to harm our homes, possessions, ground water or
									planet. They're not nearly as harsh on the skin as some of the toxic chemicals we've grown
									accustomed to using, and most are made out of natural, recyclable materials.
								</p>
								<strong> What Are Some Other Simple Steps You Can Take Toward A Greener Future? </strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Drive less. </li>
									<li>Turn off unused appliances. </li>
									<li>Unplug chargers. </li>
									<li>Turn out the lights. </li>
									<li>Take shorter showers. </li>
									<li>Adjust the thermostat. </li>
									<li>Eat less meat. </li>
									<li>Wash clothes in cold water. </li>
									<li>DITCH the plastic. </li>
									<li>Reduce! Reuse! Recycle! Rethink! </li>
								</ul>
