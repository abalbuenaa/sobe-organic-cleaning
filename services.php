							During our first visit we utilize our eco-friendly, “impact cleaning” technique to
							thoroughly clean and sanitize your entire home. <img src="img/tree-on-field.jpg" alt="Tree on a field" width="300" height="200" class="imgfix">This initial cleaning can take up
							to twice as long as our follow-up services as our cleaning professionals adjust
							their housekeeping methods to your individual cleaning needs, performing a deep,
							detailed preparation of your home to make our maintenance services that much
							more effective and efficient.

							<li>One-Time, Bi-weekly and Weekly Cleaning</li>
							<li>Spring Cleaning</li>
							<li>Move In/Move Out Cleaning</li>
							<li>Post Construction Cleaning (*call for an estimate)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Price quotes are based on average home sizes, as well as basic cleaning services.
							While we send our reliable and efficient “GREEN” technicians to assess each job
							individually, we understand that our clients’ homes may require varying degrees
							of love and attention. In order to maintain consistent levels of great service and
							efficiency, we always appreciate our customers’ straightforwardness if they feel we
							may need to spend more time than typically needed for the initial cleaning. We can
							extend your service times or levels, as well as focus on specific areas based on your
							home’s needs.

							SOBE Organic Standard Cleaning Services
						</h2>
						<span><small>*Including, but not limited to...</small></span>
						<h3>
							Kitchen
						</h3>
						<p>
						 	We know that for most of our clients the kitchen is the most popular space in their
							home; however, because of this fact it also has infamously high levels of bacteria
							and other pesky germs. We take the time to clean and sanitize your entire kitchen
							using eco-friendly products and cleaning methods. Your sinks will not only be washed,
							but also thoroughly disinfected. All countertops and stovetops will be cleaned, and
							appliance exteriors left spotless. The floors will be swept and hand washed.
						</p>
						<h3 class="clearfix">
							Bathroom
						</h3>
						<p>
							The Bathroom, much like the kitchen, is notorious for being germ-leaden.
							Normal bathroom cleansers tend to coat germs, not eliminate them. Our cleaning
							professionals always leave your toilets, sinks, and tubs cleaned to a shine and
							thoroughly disinfected. All glass and mirrors are left sparkling clean. At SOBE
							Organic Cleaning our technicians sanitize all surfaces and hand wash bathroom
							floor — we don’t miss a spot.
						</p>
						<h3 class="clearfix">
							All rooms
						</h3>
						<p>
							All rooms will be cleaned with the same attention to detail. Baseboards and ceiling
							fans are never overlooked. Linens in bedrooms can be changed, as long as the client has left a fresh set out for
							the cleaner. Carpets are thoroughly vacuumed and left allergen-free, as we use the
							latest HEPA filtrate vacuums that capture 99.98% of dust particles most regular
							vacuums leave behind, allowing you to breathe clean fresh air.
						</p>
						<h3 class="clearfix">
							Move in/out
						</h3>
						<p>
							We offer a move in/out service fit to your needs. Whether you are moving in to a
							new space or out of you old, we guarantee your home will look as though no one has
							ever lived there.
