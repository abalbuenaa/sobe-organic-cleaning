								Our Mantra
							</h1>

							<p class="dropcap">
								SOBE Organic Cleaning was started by a				(incredibly frustrated) luxury apartment property				manager, who was obsessed with cleanliness and 
								great customer service. He was disturbed by the 
								long-term health and environmental effects of 
								traditional cleaning products and tired of lazy, 
								unprofessional cleaning services.
							</p>
							<p>
								He understood the &quot;Green&quot; demand in the 
								Washington D.C. Metropolitan area, and thus 
								decided to create SOBE Organic Cleaning, 
								the &quot;ultimate solution for a cleaner environment.&quot;
							</p>
							<p>
								The SOBE Organic Cleaning mission is to improve, 
								inform and enrich the lives of the people we 
								service. We accomplish this through the use 
								of non-toxic, eco-friendly products and a 
								professional work ethic. Our goal is to provide our 
								valued clients efficient and reliable services that 
								supersede our competitors. We proudly make this 
								happen without making a dramatic change in your 
								lifestyle or a huge dent in your wallet.
